# Login Page with CAPTCHA Validation  

This is a simple demo project of a **login/registration page with CAPTCHA validation**.  
The CAPTCHA is **case-sensitive** and must be entered correctly to proceed.  


## 🚀 Features
- Username and Password input fields  
- CAPTCHA displayed on a canvas  
- CAPTCHA is **case-sensitive**  
- Refresh/Regenerate CAPTCHA button  
- Success message ✅ when CAPTCHA is correct  
- Error message ❌ when CAPTCHA is wrong  


## 📂 How It Works
1. Enter your **username** and **password**.  
2. Enter the CAPTCHA exactly as shown (case-sensitive).  
3. If correct → *"✅ You have successfully registered!"*  
4. If wrong → *"❌ Please enter the CAPTCHA correctly."* and a new CAPTCHA will be generated.  


## 🛠️ Tech Used
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **JavaScript (Canvas API for CAPTCHA)**
